- Introduction
	- Prerequisites
		- Python
		- Javascript
		- Math
			- Arithmetic
				- plus
				- minus
				- division
				- multiplication
			- Reading academic papers will help but not nessesary
			- Linear algebra
				- We will go though what we need
	- Why
		- ML is becomming bigger
		- Python is on the rise
			- Have really good libraries for datascience
			- https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/
		- Get an understanding of ML and Datascience
		- Get a better salary
		- Get an intuition of linear algebra and how it can be used 
	- About the layout of this tutorial
		- Not fully set
		- You will have a lot to say about the outline
		- Feedback from you is very valuable
			- What do you want to see
			- Is something unclear
			- How can I explain better
		- Hands on, not too theoretical
	- Some covered content (may change)
		- Linear combinations
		- Data normalization
		- Matrix multiplications
		- Move on to machine learning concepts
			- Pretty open
			- Might start with linear regression
